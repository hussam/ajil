This is a dump of an old research project that I worked on in my first year of
grad school. The goal was to implement soft rate-limiting for multicast groups.

I worked on this project about 7.5 years ago, so I don't remember all the
details vividly. After specifying the problem, I believe I started out writing a
quick simulation of the desired solution in a Ruby script. I also have a C and
Java implementations of the system. I am not sure which one came first, but I
have a vague memory that I started out with C, however that implementation is
heavily lacking. So I am not sure at this point.

Anyway, I decided to upload this project to git for archival reasons, and to
make it publicly available just in case any graduate student finds solace in it
in the future, or would like to see how I used to structure code-based research
projects when I first started grad school (I got better with time :-P).
