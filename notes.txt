	I had previously only considered limiting the amount of traffic put on the
	wire by senders without taking the size of receiver groups into consideration.
	I now believe this is erroneous because this does not accurately reflect the
	amount of total traffic induced in the network due to multicast operations.
	Ultimately, that is what we need to limit. Thus, a sender that sends 150K of
	traffic to a group of 5 receivers is less harmful than a sender that
	100K of traffic to a group of 10 receivers. Rate limiting should happen
	accordingly.
