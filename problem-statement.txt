High-level Goal
----------------
We aim to minimize the number of messages dropped between senders and receivers
without sacrificing throughput in multi-group communication settings such as
modern cloud-computing data centers.

Model Details
--------------
Nodes are assembled into overlapping groups. Each group member can be either a
sender, a receiver, or both. The goal of the communication substrate is to
maximize throughput and minimize packet loss. Senders and receivers communicate
"normally" via a light-weight best-effort group communication protocol such as
IP Multicast. However, senders and receivers have conflicting goals: Senders
aim to send at the maximum message rate to the largest number of receivers.
On the other hand, receivers have a set limit on the aggregate multicast
traffic rate they can accomodate beyond which packet loss may occur. The
receivers' rate limits may not be known a priori to senders.

If a receiver's receiving rate is below a certain group's threshold, it is
switched to communicating via TCP unicast with one or more of the senders in its
group. Additionally, senders maintain lists of their multicast recipients.
Senders have to balance their multicast rate against the number of multicast
receivers. In general, senders optimize for: (multicast message rate * number of multicast members).
Given the conflicting utility functions for senders and receivers, a single
optimal sending strategy may not be always obvious.
