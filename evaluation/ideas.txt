Ideas for evaluation
--------------------

Ymir:
   - Fairness (groups/senders want vs. allotted)
   - Responsiveness (how fast does it react to crisis)
   - Correctness (is the limit obeyed)

Mahesh:
   - Obeying the limit with different alpha, beta, C params
   - Group fairness with the different params
   - Sender fairness with the different params

*****

Plotting Ideas:
   Fairness Scatter Plot,
      x-axis is the group #
      y-axis is the fairness fraction (allotted/want)
      it should look like a line since they all should be the same

   Fairness CDF,
      95% of groups have a fairness fraction between 0.8 and 0.9
